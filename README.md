**Multi-Agent Container Sandbox** by [Cloud Exit](https://cloud-exit.com)

Run AI coding assistants (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) in isolated containers with defense-in-depth security.


## Getting Started

```bash
# Install (Linux/macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud-exit/exitbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh

# Run the setup wizard (first time)
exitbox setup

# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run an agent (builds image automatically on first run)
exitbox run claude

# Or run other agents
exitbox run codex
exitbox run opencode
```

ExitBox automatically:
- Builds the container image if needed
- Imports your existing config (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, etc.) on first run
- Mounts your project directory
- Sets up the network firewall (Squid proxy)

## Features

- **Rootless Containers** — runs without host root privileges using Podman's user namespaces (Docker fallback supported)
- **Squid Proxy Firewall** — strict domain allowlisting with hard egress isolation; agents can only reach approved destinations
- **Runtime Domain Requests** — agents request access to new domains at runtime via `exitbox-allow`; host user approves via popup
- **Encrypted Vault** — AES-256 + Argon2id encrypted secret storage with per-access approval popups; agents can read and write secrets from inside the container
- **Sandbox-Aware Agents** — automatic instruction injection tells agents about container restrictions, vault usage, and security rules
- **Named Resumable Sessions** — save and resume agent conversations by name across container restarts
- **Multi-Agent Support** — run Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, or OpenCode in the same isolated environment
- **Workspace Isolation** — named contexts (personal, work, client) with separate credentials, tools, and vault per workspace
- **Supply-Chain Hardened Installs** — Claude Code installed via direct binary download with SHA-256 checksum verification
- **Alpine Base Image** — minimal ~5 MB base with 3-layer image hierarchy and incremental rebuilds
- **Setup Wizard** — interactive TUI that configures roles, languages, tools, agents, firewall, and vault in one pass
- **Cross-Platform** — native binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

### Security

The project's security posture is rated **High / Robust**, employing a "Defense in Depth" strategy:

1.  **DNS Isolation (The "Moat")**: Containers cannot resolve external domain names directly. This forces all traffic through the proxy, as the container "knows" nothing of the outside internet.
2.  **Mandatory Proxy Usage**: Since direct DNS fails, tools are forced to use the configured `http_proxy`. Bypassing these variables results in immediate connection failure.
3.  **Proxy Access Control**: The Squid proxy actively inspects destinations, enforcing a strict allow/deny policy (returning `403 Forbidden` for blocked domains).
4.  **Capability Restrictions**: `CAP_NET_RAW` and other capabilities are dropped, preventing raw socket creation and network enumeration attacks (e.g., `ping` is disabled).

Additional hardening:
- **No Privilege Escalation**: `--security-opt=no-new-privileges:true` enforced
- **Capability Dropping**: `--cap-drop=ALL` removes all Linux capabilities
- **Resource Limits**: Default 8GB RAM / 4 CPUs to prevent DoS
- **Secure Defaults**: SSH keys (`~/.ssh`) and AWS credentials (`~/.aws`) are NOT mounted by default

### Sandbox-Aware Agents

ExitBox automatically injects sandbox instructions into each agent on container start. This tells the agent it is running inside a restricted container so it won't attempt actions that can't work (e.g., running `docker`, `podman`, or managing infrastructure).

Instructions are written to each agent's native global instructions file:

| Agent    | Instructions file                        |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Claude   | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`                    |
| Codex    | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`                     |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`           |

If the file already exists (e.g., from your own global instructions), ExitBox appends the sandbox notice once. The instructions inform the agent about network restrictions, dropped capabilities, and the read-only nature of the environment so it can focus on writing and debugging code within `/workspace`.

### Named Resumable Sessions

When agents like Claude Code and Codex exit, they display a resume token (e.g. `claude --resume <id>`). ExitBox captures this token and can pass it on the next run, so you seamlessly resume where you left off.

- **Named sessions** — set a session name explicitly with `--name "<session>"`; if omitted, ExitBox auto-generates one using local time (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`)
- **Named session resume** — when `--name "<session>"` is provided, ExitBox resumes that named session automatically if it exists (use `--no-resume` to force fresh)
- **Disabled by default** — enable via "Auto-resume sessions" in `exitbox setup` or set `auto_resume: true` in `config.yaml`
- **Always shown at exit** — ExitBox always prints a resume command after a session ends (e.g. `exitbox run codex --name "2026-02-11 14:51:02" --resume`)
- **Workspace-aware** — resume commands include `--workspace` when running a non-default workspace
- **Disable per-session** with `--no-resume` to start a fresh session
- Resume tokens are stored per-workspace, per-agent, per-project, and per-session at `~/.config/exitbox/profiles/global/<workspace>/<agent>/projects/<project_key>/sessions/<session_key>/.resume-token`

### Encrypted Vault

ExitBox includes a built-in encrypted secret vault so agents can read and write API keys, tokens, and credentials without `.env` files being exposed inside the container.

- **AES-256 encryption** with **Argon2id** key derivation — no external dependencies required
- **Per-access approval**: Every secret read or write triggers a tmux popup requiring explicit user confirmation
- **Agent-initiated writes**: Agents can store secrets directly via `exitbox-vault set <KEY> <VALUE>` from inside the container — the host user approves each write via popup
- **`.env` masking**: When vault is enabled, all `.env*` files are automatically hidden inside the container
- **Embedded storage**: Secrets are stored in an encrypted [Badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) database per workspace

The first access in a session prompts for the vault password. Subsequent reads only require the per-key approval popup. Inside the container, agents use `exitbox-vault` to read and write secrets via IPC. See [Vault Management](#vault-management) for the full CLI reference.

## Supported Agents

| Agent       | Description                  | Host Requirement |
|:------------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------|
| `claude`    | Anthropic's Claude Code CLI  | None (installed in container) |
| `codex`     | OpenAI's Codex CLI           | None (downloaded)|
| `opencode`  | OpenCode AI assistant        | None (binary download)  |

All agents are installed inside the container. Existing host config (`~/.claude`, etc.) is imported once into managed storage on first run. Use `exitbox import <agent>` (or `exitbox import all`) to re-seed from host config. Use `--workspace` to target a specific workspace.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Podman** (recommended) or **Docker** — at least one is required; Podman is preferred for its rootless, daemonless design
- For Windows: **Docker Desktop** provides the Docker CLI that ExitBox uses

### Linux

```bash
# Install Podman (recommended) or Docker
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y podman   # Ubuntu/Debian
# OR: install Docker - see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

# Install exitbox
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud-exit/exitbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh

# Run the setup wizard
exitbox setup

# Run an agent
exitbox run claude
```

### macOS

```bash
# Install Podman (recommended) or Docker
brew install podman
podman machine init && podman machine start
# OR: brew install --cask docker

# Install exitbox
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud-exit/exitbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh

# Run the setup wizard
exitbox setup
```

### Windows

ExitBox runs natively on Windows with Docker Desktop.

1. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
2. Download the latest `exitbox-windows-amd64.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/cloud-exit/exitbox/releases)
3. Rename to `exitbox.exe` and place in a directory on your `PATH` (e.g., `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\bin\`)
4. Run the setup wizard:

```powershell
exitbox setup
```

### Windows (WSL2)

Alternatively, use ExitBox inside WSL2 for a Linux-native experience:

```powershell
# In PowerShell as Administrator
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

Then in WSL2:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y podman
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud-exit/exitbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
exitbox setup
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cloud-Exit/exitbox.git
cd exitbox
make build       # builds ./exitbox
make install     # installs to ~/.local/bin/exitbox
```

## Commands

### Setup

```bash
exitbox setup             # Run the interactive setup wizard (recommended first step)
```

### Running Agents

```bash
exitbox run claude [args]     # Run Claude Code
exitbox run codex [args]      # Run Codex
exitbox run opencode [args]   # Run OpenCode
```

### Management

```bash
exitbox list              # List available agents and build status
exitbox enable <agent>    # Enable an agent
exitbox disable <agent>   # Disable an agent
exitbox rebuild <agent>   # Force rebuild of agent image
exitbox rebuild all       # Rebuild all enabled agents
exitbox uninstall <agent> # Remove agent images and config
exitbox aliases           # Print shell aliases for ~/.bashrc
```

### Config Generation

Generate agent configuration files for third-party LLM servers (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, etc.):

```bash
exitbox generate opencode              # Configure OpenCode for a custom provider
exitbox generate claude -w work        # Configure Claude Code in 'work' workspace
exitbox generate codex                 # Configure Codex for a custom provider
```

The wizard prompts for server URL, API key, tests connectivity via `GET /v1/models`,
lets you pick a model from the discovered list, and writes the correct config file
into the workspace profile directory. Existing config is preserved via deep merge.

When vault is enabled for the workspace, the wizard offers to store the API key
in the vault instead of writing it to the config file.

### Workspace Management

Workspaces are named contexts (e.g. `personal`, `work`, `client-a`) that provide isolated agent configurations, credentials, and development stacks. Each workspace stores its own agent config directories, so API keys and conversation history are kept separate.

```bash
exitbox workspaces list                    # List all workspaces
exitbox workspaces add <name>              # Create a new workspace (interactive)
exitbox workspaces remove <name>           # Delete a workspace
exitbox workspaces use <name>              # Set the active workspace
exitbox workspaces default [name]          # Get or set the default workspace
exitbox workspaces status                  # Show workspace resolution chain
```

### Session Management

Named sessions are stored per-project. You can list and remove them from the CLI:

```bash
exitbox sessions list                          # List saved sessions for current project/workspace
exitbox sessions list --agent codex            # Filter by agent
exitbox sessions list -w work                  # Inspect another workspace
exitbox sessions rm "2026-02-11 14:51:02"      # Remove one named session
exitbox sessions rm "my-session" --agent claude # Remove for a specific agent only
```

Shell completion:
- `exitbox sessions rm <Tab>` suggests saved session names for the current project
- `exitbox run <agent> --resume <Tab>` suggests saved session names for that agent

### Vault Management

```bash
exitbox vault init -w <workspace>       # Initialize a new vault
exitbox vault set <KEY> -w <workspace>  # Set a secret (value prompted securely)
exitbox vault get <KEY> -w <workspace>  # Retrieve a secret
exitbox vault list -w <workspace>       # List secret keys
exitbox vault delete <KEY>              # Delete a secret
exitbox vault import <file>             # Import key-value pairs from a .env file
exitbox vault edit                      # Edit secrets in $EDITOR (KEY=VALUE format)
exitbox vault status                    # Show vault state for a workspace
exitbox vault destroy                   # Permanently delete a vault
```

#### In-Container Vault Commands

Inside the container, agents use the `exitbox-vault` binary to interact with the vault over IPC:

```bash
exitbox-vault list                    # List key names
exitbox-vault get <KEY>               # Get a secret value (stdout)
exitbox-vault set <KEY> <VALUE>       # Store a secret (host approval required)
exitbox-vault env                     # Print all KEY=VALUE pairs
```

Every `get` and `set` triggers a tmux popup on the host terminal requiring explicit approval before the operation proceeds.

#### Agent Secret Workflow

When an agent detects or generates a secret (API key, token, password), it follows this workflow:

1. **Ask for a key name** — the agent prompts the user for a vault key name before attempting to store anything
2. **Generate and store in one step** — the secret is piped directly into `exitbox-vault set` so it never appears in command output:
   ```bash
   exitbox-vault set MY_TOKEN "$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))")"
   ```
3. **Host approves** — a tmux popup appears on the host terminal; the host user must approve the write
4. **Use via variable** — the agent retrieves the secret into a shell variable and uses it inline:
   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(exitbox-vault get MY_TOKEN)
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.example.com
   ```
5. **Redact output** — any command output that might echo the secret is captured and redacted before display

Agents are automatically informed about vault commands and these rules via sandbox instructions injected at container start.

#### How Workspaces Work

- **Isolated credentials**: Each workspace has its own agent config directory at `~/.config/exitbox/profiles/global/<workspace>/<agent>/`. API keys, auth tokens, and conversation history are not shared between workspaces.
- **Development stacks**: Each workspace can have its own set of development profiles (languages/tools). The setup wizard or `exitbox workspaces add` lets you pick the stack for each workspace.
- **Per-project auto-detection**: Workspaces can be scoped to a directory. When you run an agent from that directory, ExitBox automatically uses the matching workspace.
- **Default workspace**: Set via `exitbox setup` or `exitbox workspaces default`. Used when no directory-scoped workspace matches.
- **Credential import**: When creating a workspace, you can import credentials from the host or copy them from an existing workspace. You can also import later with `exitbox import <agent> --workspace <name>`.

#### Workspace Resolution Order

1. **CLI flag**: `exitbox run -w work claude` — explicit override for this session
2. **Directory-scoped**: If the current directory matches a workspace's `directory` field in `config.yaml`
3. **Default workspace**: The workspace set as default in settings
4. **Active workspace**: The last-used workspace from `config.yaml`
5. **Fallback**: `default`

#### In-Container Menus

Inside a running agent session, ExitBox provides two dedicated `fzf` menus:

- **Ctrl+Alt+P** — workspace menu (save current session, then switch workspace)
- **Ctrl+Alt+S** — session menu (switch to another named session or start a new timestamp session)

**Note**: Credentials are bind-mounted at container start for security isolation. If you switch to a workspace that wasn't mounted, ExitBox warns you that credentials for that workspace aren't available and suggests re-running with the `--workspace` flag.

#### Workspace Examples

```bash
# Create workspaces for different contexts
exitbox workspaces add work
exitbox workspaces add personal

# Run claude in a specific workspace
exitbox run -w work claude
exitbox run -w personal claude

# Set the default workspace
exitbox workspaces default work

# Now "exitbox run claude" uses the "work" workspace by default
exitbox run claude
```

#### Shell Aliases

Generate recommended shell aliases for quick access:

```bash
exitbox aliases
```

Or add custom aliases to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
alias claude-work="exitbox run -w work claude"
alias claude-personal="exitbox run -w personal claude"
alias codex-work="exitbox run -w work codex"
```

### Utilities

```bash
exitbox info              # Show system information
exitbox logs <agent>      # Show latest agent log file
exitbox clean             # Clean unused container resources
exitbox clean all         # Remove all exitbox images
exitbox projects          # List known projects
```

### Shell Completion

ExitBox provides tab-completion for bash, zsh, and fish:

```bash
# Zsh (add to ~/.zshrc)
eval "$(exitbox completion zsh)"

# Bash (add to ~/.bashrc)
eval "$(exitbox completion bash)"

# Fish
exitbox completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/exitbox.fish
```

For faster shell startup, generate a file instead of using `eval`:

```bash
# Zsh
exitbox completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_exitbox
# then add to ~/.zshrc (before compinit): fpath=(~/.zfunc $fpath)

# Bash
exitbox completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/exitbox
```

### Options

```bash
exitbox run -f claude              # Disable network firewall *DANGEROUS*
exitbox run -r claude              # Mount workspace as read-only (safety)
exitbox run -v claude              # Enable verbose output
exitbox run -n claude              # Don't pass host environment variables
exitbox run -n -e MY_KEY=val claude  # Only pass specific env vars
exitbox run -i /tmp/foo claude     # Mount /tmp/foo into /workspace/foo
exitbox run -t nodejs,go claude    # Add Alpine packages to image (persisted)
exitbox run -a api.example.com claude  # Allow extra domains for this session
exitbox run -u claude              # Check for and apply agent updates
exitbox run --no-resume claude     # Start a fresh session (don't resume previous)
exitbox run --name "my-session" claude   # No --resume needed; resumes if session exists
exitbox run --resume "my-session" claude # Resume by named session (or by session id)
exitbox run -w work claude         # Use a specific workspace for this session
```

All flags have long forms: `-f`/`--no-firewall`, `-r`/`--read-only`, `-v`/`--verbose`, `-n`/`--no-env`, `--resume [SESSION|TOKEN]`, `--no-resume`, `--name`, `-i`/`--include-dir`, `-t`/`--tools`, `-a`/`--allow-urls`, `-u`/`--update`, `-w`/`--workspace`.

## Available Profiles

Profiles are pre-configured development environments. The setup wizard suggests profiles based on your developer role, or you can add them manually.

## Configuration

ExitBox uses YAML configuration files stored in `~/.config/exitbox/` (Linux/macOS) or `%APPDATA%\exitbox\` (Windows).

### Setup Wizard

The recommended way to configure ExitBox is through the setup wizard:

```bash
exitbox setup
```

The wizard generates `config.yaml` and `allowlist.yaml` tailored to your developer role. It walks you through up to 10 steps: roles, languages, tools, packages, workspace name, credentials, agents, settings, firewall (domain allowlist), and review. Some steps are shown conditionally (e.g., credentials only when other workspaces exist). Re-run it at any time to reconfigure.

### config.yaml

The main configuration file controls which agents are enabled, extra packages, and default settings:

```yaml
version: 1
roles:
  - backend
  - devops

workspaces:
  active: default
  items:
    - name: default
      development:
        - go
        - python
    - name: work
      development:
        - node
        - python
      vault:
        enabled: true

agents:
  claude:
    enabled: true
  codex:
    enabled: false
  opencode:
    enabled: true

tools:
  user:
    - postgresql-client
    - redis

settings:
  auto_update: false
  status_bar: true            # Show "ExitBox <version> - <agent>" bar at top of terminal
  default_workspace: default  # Workspace used when no directory match is found
  default_flags:
    no_firewall: false        # Set true to disable firewall by default
    read_only: false          # Set true to mount workspace as read-only by default
    no_env: false             # Set true to not pass host env vars by default
    auto_resume: false        # Set true to auto-resume agent sessions
```

**Settings reference:**
- `status_bar` — Thin status bar at the top of the terminal showing agent, workspace, and version. Enabled by default.
- `auto_resume` — Automatically resume the last agent conversation on next run. Disabled by default. Enable in `exitbox setup` or set to `true`. Disable per-session with `--no-resume`.

### allowlist.yaml

The network allowlist is organized by category for readability:

```yaml
version: 1
ai_providers:
  - anthropic.com
  - claude.ai
  - openai.com
  # ...

development:
  - github.com
  - npmjs.org
  - pypi.org
  # ...

cloud_services:
  - googleapis.com
  - amazonaws.com
  - azure.com

custom:
  - mycompany.com
```

### Custom Tools

Add extra Alpine packages to your container images:

1. **CLI flag** (persisted automatically):
   ```bash
   exitbox run -t nodejs,python3-dev claude
   ```

2. **config.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   tools:
     user:
       - nodejs
       - python3-dev
   ```

The image rebuilds automatically when tools change.

### Resource Limits

ExitBox enforces default resource limits to prevent runaway agents:
- **Memory**: 8GB
- **CPU**: 4 vCPUs

### What Gets Mounted

ExitBox uses **managed config** (import-only) with per-workspace isolation. On first run, host config is copied into the active workspace's managed directory. Host originals are never modified. Use `exitbox import <agent>` to re-seed from host config at any time, optionally with `--workspace <name>` to target a specific workspace.

All managed paths follow the pattern `~/.config/exitbox/profiles/global/<workspace>/<agent>/`. For example, with workspace `default` and agent `claude`:

| Agent    | Managed Path (under workspace agent dir)    | Container Path                    |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Claude   | `.claude/`                                   | `/home/user/.claude`              |
| Claude   | `.claude.json`                               | `/home/user/.claude.json`         |
| Claude   | `.config/`                                   | `/home/user/.config`              |

Your project directory is mounted at `/workspace`.

When Codex is enabled, ExitBox publishes callback port `1455` on the shared `exitbox-squid` container and relays it to the active Codex container, so OrbStack/private-networking callback flows work reliably.

### Environment Variables

| Variable              | Description                          |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| `VERBOSE`             | Enable verbose output                |
| `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`   | Force runtime (`podman` or `docker`) |
| `EXITBOX_NO_FIREWALL`| Disable firewall (`true`)            |
| `EXITBOX_SQUID_DNS`  | Squid DNS servers (comma/space list, default: `1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8`) |
| `EXITBOX_SQUID_DNS_SEARCH` | Squid DNS search domains (default: `.` to disable inherited search suffixes) |

## Architecture

### Alpine Base Image

All agent images are built on **Alpine Linux**. The base package list is embedded in the binary and shared by all image builds.

Alpine was chosen for:
- **Small image size**: ~5 MB base vs ~80 MB for Debian slim
- **musl libc**: Matches the native binaries shipped by Claude Code, git-delta, and yq
- **Consistent package manager**: `apk` is used everywhere — base image, profiles, and user tools

### 3-Layer Image Hierarchy

```
base image (Alpine + tools)
  └── core image (agent-specific install)
        └── project image (development profiles layered on)
```

Each layer uses label-based caching (`exitbox.version`, `exitbox.agent.version`, `exitbox.tools.hash`, `exitbox.profiles.hash`) so rebuilds are fast and incremental.

### Supply-Chain Hardened Agent Installs

Claude Code is installed via **direct binary download with SHA-256 checksum verification** against Anthropic's signed manifest — no `curl | bash`. The download URL is auto-discovered from the official installer if the hardcoded endpoint ever changes. The build aborts on any checksum mismatch.

## Network Firewall

ExitBox uses a **Squid Proxy** container to enforce strict destination allowlisting:

1. **Hard egress control**: Agent containers run on an internal-only network with no direct internet route.
2. **Proxy path**: Squid is dual-homed (internal + egress networks), so outbound traffic must traverse Squid.
3. **Allowlist**: Only destinations listed in `allowlist.yaml` are permitted through the proxy.
4. **Fail closed**: Missing or empty allowlist blocks all outbound destinations.

### Configuring the Allowlist

Edit `~/.config/exitbox/allowlist.yaml` and add domains to the `custom` list:

```yaml
custom:
  - mycompany.com
  - api.internal.example.com
```

Domain formats:
- `example.com` allows `example.com` and its subdomains
- `api.example.com` allows only that host scope (and deeper subdomains)
- `*.example.com` is accepted as wildcard syntax
- `8.8.8.8` allows a specific IPv4 destination
- `2606:4700:4700::1111` allows a specific IPv6 destination

### Temporary Domain Access

Allow extra domains for a single session without editing the allowlist:

```bash
exitbox run -a api.example.com,cdn.example.com claude
```

The domains are merged into the Squid config and applied via **hot-reload** (`squid -k reconfigure`) — no proxy restart, no container restart, no connection drop. These domains do not persist across sessions.

### Runtime Domain Requests

When an agent needs access to a domain not in the allowlist, it (or the user) can request it at runtime from inside the container:

```bash
exitbox-allow registry.npmjs.org
```

This connects to the host via a Unix socket IPC channel. The host user is prompted on their terminal to approve or deny the request. Approved domains are added to the Squid config and hot-reloaded immediately — no container restart needed.

- Requires firewall mode (not available with `--no-firewall`)
- The host prompt appears on `/dev/tty`, so it works even while the agent is running
- Agents are informed about `exitbox-allow` via the sandbox instructions injected at container start

### Disabling the Firewall

```bash
exitbox run --no-firewall claude   # *DANGEROUS* - disables all network restrictions
```

## Why Podman?

| Feature              | Podman           | Docker               |
|:---------------------|:-----------------|:---------------------|
| Rootless by default  | Yes              | No (requires group)  |
| Daemonless           | Yes              | No (requires daemon) |
| Security             | Better isolation | Requires daemon root |

On Windows, Docker Desktop is the primary supported runtime.

## Troubleshooting

### Podman: "cannot find UID/GID for user"

```bash
sudo usermod --add-subuids 100000-165535 --add-subgids 100000-165535 $USER
podman system migrate
```

### Podman on macOS: "Cannot connect to Podman"

```bash
podman machine start
```

### Docker: Permission Denied

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### Windows: Docker Desktop not detected

Ensure Docker Desktop is running and the `docker` CLI is on your `PATH`. You can verify with:

```powershell
docker info
```


## Uninstallation

```bash
# Remove the binary
rm -f ~/.local/bin/exitbox

# Remove configuration and data
rm -rf ~/.config/exitbox ~/.cache/exitbox ~/.local/share/exitbox

# Remove container images
podman images | grep exitbox | awk '{print $3}' | xargs podman rmi -f
# OR for Docker:
docker images | grep exitbox | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker rmi -f
```

On Windows, delete `exitbox.exe` and remove `%APPDATA%\exitbox\`.
